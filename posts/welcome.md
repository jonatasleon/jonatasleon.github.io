Hello and welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and learnings.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- **Technical articles** about web development, programming, and technology
- **Personal reflections** on my journey as a developer
- **Tutorials and guides** that I've found helpful
- **Project updates** and behind-the-scenes content

## Getting Started

If you're reading this, you've successfully set up your blog! To create new posts:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `posts/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with `title`, `date`, and optionally `excerpt`
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Push to GitHub and the blog will automatically deploy

## Markdown Support

This blog supports full Markdown syntax including:

- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists and links
- Images and more!
- **LaTeX math equations** - both inline and block format

Here's a code example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Math Equations

This blog also supports LaTeX math equations! You can use inline math like $E = mc^2$ or display block equations:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

This is Bayes' theorem, which is fundamental in probability theory. You can write any mathematical expression using LaTeX syntax!

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more content!
